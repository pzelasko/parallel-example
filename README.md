# GNU Parallel usage example

This is a short example of how to use GNU Parallel to either parallelize your computation on a single machine or distribute it on any number of nodes. It is by no means a complete solution - it's rather a starting point for your own experiments. The computation example uses Python 3.6 and the [scikit-learn library and is based on the scikit-learn's tutorial](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html).
